# Foundation AI Research Analysis Project

This project contains a comprehensive analysis of 104 foundations and their AI grant activities, with an interactive dashboard for exploring the results.

## Project Overview

This research project systematically analyzed foundations to assess their AI readiness and grant activities. Using Claude's WebSearch capabilities, we created detailed profiles for 82 foundations (out of 104 attempted) and built an interactive dashboard for data exploration.

## Key Files

### Core Analysis Files
- **`foundation_list.txt`** - Original list of 104 foundations to analyze
- **`results/`** - Directory containing 111 YAML analysis files (some foundations had multiple iterations)
- **`dashboard_data.json`** - Aggregated statistics from all analyzed foundations

### Dashboard System
- **`dashboard_standalone.html`** - Main interactive dashboard with embedded data (recommended)
- **`foundation_detail.html`** - Individual foundation profile template (uses Valhalla Foundation as example)
- **`foundation_cards.js`** - Complete dataset of all 82 foundations in JavaScript format

### Supporting Scripts
- **`aggregate_data.py`** - Parses YAML files and generates dashboard statistics
- **`taxonomy_standardization.py`** - Maps foundation taxonomy values to standardized categories
- **`analyze_taxonomy_values.py`** - Analysis tool for identifying unique taxonomy values

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Collection Process
1. **Systematic Web Search**: 4 targeted searches per foundation using Claude WebSearch:
   - AI grants and artificial intelligence initiatives
   - Philanthropy profile, assets, and location
   - AI funding strategy and technology approach
   - Machine learning grants and research funding

2. **Structured Analysis**: Each foundation received comprehensive evaluation across:
   - **Foundation Identity** (7 dimensions): Type, age, decision-making, sourcing, endowment, geography, approach
   - **AI Strategy** (7 dimensions): Integration, readiness score, outcome, output, lifecycle, investment, innovation
   - **Economic Opportunity Strategy** (1 dimension): Skills vs. jobs focus

3. **AI Readiness Scoring**: 0-10 scale assessment based on:
   - Existing AI grant activities
   - Strategic AI integration
   - Innovation focus and capacity
   - Technology sector expertise
   - Available resources and assets

### Taxonomy Standardization
Original analysis produced 37+ different foundation type values. These were standardized to 8 clean categories:
- **Corporate** (30.5% - 25 foundations)
- **Private** (30.5% - 25 foundations) 
- **Operating** (17.1% - 14 foundations)
- **Family** (12.2% - 10 foundations)
- **Unknown** (4.9% - 4 foundations)
- **Venture Capital** (2.4% - 2 foundations)
- **Collaborative** (1.2% - 1 foundation)
- **Consulting** (1.2% - 1 foundation)

## Key Findings

### AI Readiness Distribution
- **High AI Readiness (9-10)**: 21 foundations (25.6%)

- **Medium-Low (3-4)**: 17 foundations (20.7%)
- **Low (0-2)**: 15 foundations (18.3%)
- **Medium (5-6)**: 12 foundations (14.6%)

### AI Strategy Patterns
- **61%** of foundations aim to increase AI use for social impact
- **52.4%** focus on AI solution creation
- **50%** have high innovation focus
- **37.8%** integrate AI into existing program verticals
- **25.6%** treat AI as its own dedicated vertical

### Foundation Characteristics
- **68.3%** use invitation-only grant sourcing
- **79.3%** employ multi-year, high engagement funding approaches
- **30.5%** have mega-endowments ($1B+)
- **37.8%** have national geographic focus, 35.4% global focus

## Interactive Dashboard Features

### Complete Taxonomy Visualization
The dashboard shows percentage breakdowns for all 15 taxonomy dimensions:

**Foundation Identity (6 dimensions):**
- Foundation Type, Geographic Focus, Decision Making Structure
- Grant Sourcing Strategy, Endowment Size, Funding Approach

**AI Strategy (6 dimensions):**  
- AI Funding Integration, AI Readiness Score, AI Outcome
- AI Related Output, Internal AI Investment, Innovation Focus

**Economic Opportunity Strategy (1 dimension):**
- EO Focus Area (Skills vs. Jobs vs. Both)
