## Top 3 Engagement Opportunities

### 1. **AI Career Navigation Ecosystem Expansion**
**Rationale**: $3M+ investment in 2025 demonstrates appetite for scaling AI workforce tools nationally. CareerNet benchmarking shows sophisticated understanding of competitive AI development.

**Approach**: Propose AI applications that complement existing portfolio (CareerVillage, Basta, CodePath) or expand to new underserved populations while maintaining focus on ages 16-24.

---

### 2. **Veterans-to-Civilian AI Career Tools**
**Rationale**: Foundation serves 250K annual military transitions but current AI investments focus on opportunity youth. Veteran career navigation is underserved by AI applications.

**Approach**: Pitch AI solution for military skill translation, civilian job matching, and career pathway recommendations specifically for veteran population.

---

### 3. **SkillUp Coalition AI Integration**
**Rationale**: Recent merger (2024-2025) of 100,000 Opportunities Initiative with SkillUp Coalition created expanded employer partnership network. Proven framework (200K+ hires) could be enhanced with AI.

**Approach**: Propose AI-powered employer-employee matching, skills gap analysis, or career advancement tracking to scale impact of coalition beyond current capabilities.

## Key Leadership

**Vivek Varma, CEO**
> "AI's influence and technology is rapidly transforming the way each of us work and live and we believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage this technology to address the gaps in career navigation"

**Marie Groark, Managing Director**
> "We believe that with the right tools and career navigation resources, young adults can fully tap into their potential and achieve career success"

## Strategic Partnerships (AI-Focused)

- Renaissance Philanthropy (CareerNet)
- CareerVillage (Coach platform)
- Basta (Seekr tool)
- CodePath (AI-native education)
- Mayo Clinic ($5M AI education)
- National Governors Association (State-led service programs)
- The Learning Agency (AI benchmarking)

---

## Engagement Considerations

✅ **Strengths for Partnership:**
- $225M assets provide sustained investment capacity
- Multi-year, high-engagement funding approach
- Proven ability to scale (200K+ hires through 100,000 Opportunities Initiative)
- Washington state location = access to tech ecosystem
- Demonstrated collaborative approach with multiple AI partners

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- **No unsolicited proposals** - requires warm introduction or invitation
- Strategic selectivity in partnerships
- Must demonstrate clear alignment with opportunity youth (ages 16-24) mission
- Preference for solutions with national scaling potential
- Focus on **production-ready** or **near-scale** AI products, not early R&D

## Why Schultz Foundation Stands Out

**Among Top 15% Nationally in AI Readiness**

The Schultz Family Foundation is exceptionally positioned at the intersection of AI innovation and economic opportunity. Unlike most family foundations, they demonstrate:

1. **Technical Sophistication**: Deep understanding of LLMs, AI benchmarking, and competitive algorithm development
2. **Strategic Focus**: Concentrated investment in workforce development AI (not scattered across all programs)
3. **Proven Execution**: Multiple successful AI partnerships moving from pilots to production
4. **Clear Vision**: Leadership articulates compelling AI transformation opportunity
5. **Scale Mindset**: Howard Schultz's Starbucks background brings understanding of national scaling challenges

**Comparable to corporate foundations (Microsoft, Google.org) in AI focus, with the agility and strategic focus of a family foundation.**
