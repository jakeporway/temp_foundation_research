### Objection Handling

**Objection**: "This seems to overlap with our existing CareerVillage/Basta/CodePath investments"

**Response**: "We specifically designed our approach to complement your existing portfolio. [CareerVillage/Basta/CodePath] focuses on [their unique value]. We address [specific gap] that those tools don't cover. In fact, our solution could integrate with [existing partner] to create [combined value]. Rather than competing, we strengthen your AI career navigation ecosystem."

---

**Objection**: "We just made a $3M+ investment in career navigation AI. Our budget may be tapped out."

**Response**: "That's exactly why this timing is perfect. Your 2025 investment demonstrates clear appetite for AI career navigation.

Here's our [technical validation / third-party assessment / pilot results]."

---

**Objection**: "Our focus is ages 16-24. Your solution seems broader."

**Response**: "You're right that we can serve broader populations, but we designed specifically for ages 16-24 because [reason]. [X%] of our current users are in that age range, and our [specific feature] addresses challenges unique to opportunity youth like [example]. We're proposing to focus this partnership exclusively on ages 16-24 to align with your mission."

---

**Objection**: "We prefer multi-year commitments. What happens after year 1?"

**Response**: "We're specifically seeking multi-year partnership - that's why we chose to approach Schultz Foundation. Our proposal is for [3-5 years] with [milestones by year]. Year 1 focuses on [milestone], Year 2 on [milestone], Year 3 on [milestone]. By year [X], we achieve sustainability through [model] and transition from growth funding to [next phase]. We want a strategic partner for the journey, not just pilot funding."
