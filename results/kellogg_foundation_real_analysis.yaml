strategic_assessment:
  ai_readiness_score: 2
  readiness_level: Low - Traditional children and family focus with no AI philanthropy
  engagement_recommendations:
    - $8.7B endowment and $342.9M annual giving provides massive capacity but no AI focus
    - Traditional children and family welfare mission may not align with AI development funding
    - Focus on early childhood (birth through age 8) could potentially include educational technology
    - Racial equity emphasis could align with inclusive AI development initiatives
    - Priority geographic focus (Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, New Orleans) limits scope
    - Open application process with no deadlines provides accessible entry point
    - Grant range $100K-$5M+ suitable for substantial AI initiatives if mission-aligned
    - 90% domestic funding allocation could support US AI development projects
    - Working families focus could include AI workforce development and transition support
    - Investment use of AI demonstrates foundation awareness of AI capabilities
