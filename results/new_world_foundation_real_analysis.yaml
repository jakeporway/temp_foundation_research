strategic_assessment:
  ai_readiness_score: 1
  readiness_level: Very Low - Social movement foundation with no AI focus or technology programming
  engagement_recommendations:
    - New World Foundation has no AI programming and is unlikely candidate for AI partnership
    - $100M Quality Jobs Fund demonstrates significant financial capacity but focused on labor organizing
    - Social justice mission could potentially intersect with AI ethics and algorithmic bias issues
    - Environmental justice work could theoretically connect to AI applications for climate solutions
    - Labor organizing focus might address AI's impact on workforce displacement and automation
    - No unsolicited proposals accepted, making outreach challenging without existing connections
    - 4/4 Star Charity Navigator rating indicates strong organizational management and transparency
    - Colin Greer's 40-year leadership (since 1985) suggests stable institutional approach
    - Coalition-building expertise could be valuable for AI governance and policy advocacy
    - Focus on underserved communities addresses important equity considerations in AI development

  - No unsolicited proposals policy limits transparency into potential new programming areas
  - Strong social movement focus suggests AI programming highly unlikely
  - Traditional activist and labor organizing mission may not align with technology innovation funding
