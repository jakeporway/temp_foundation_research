  engagement_recommendations:
    - OAI, Inc. is a worker safety training nonprofit, not an AI-focused foundation or grant-maker
    - 50+ years of workforce development experience could potentially inform AI workforce transition discussions
    - NIEHS funding relationship demonstrates capacity to manage federal grants and research programs
    - Chicago location provides access to midwest technology and research communities
    - Workforce development expertise could address AI's impact on worker safety and job displacement
    - Community-based approach could inform equitable AI deployment in industrial and safety contexts
    - Vision of "everyone reaching their career potential" could align with AI workforce development goals
    - Not appropriate for direct AI funding requests as organization receives rather than provides grants
    - Limited relevance for AI research or development partnerships given safety training mission
    - Note: Other organizations with "OAI" acronym (OpenAI, Open Philanthropy) are separate major AI funders
