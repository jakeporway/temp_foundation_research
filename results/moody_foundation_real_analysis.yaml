    - Professional development for educators could include AI literacy training
    - Traditional foundation mission may not align with AI development funding
    - Board meets quarterly creating specific application timing requirements
    - Most grants average $25K but foundation capable of major commitments ($100M+ grants)
    - Foundation-initiated projects suggest potential for proactive AI education initiatives
