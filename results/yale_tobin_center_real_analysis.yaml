research_limitations:
  - Analysis based on publicly available web information
  - AI activity may exist but not be publicly documented  
  - Research center structure may limit transparency into specific AI funding activities
  - Academic focus may include AI policy research not specifically documented as AI initiatives
  - Connection to Yale's broader AI initiative may influence research directions not yet publicly visible
  - James Tobin legacy focus on economic policy may constrain expansion into broader AI research areas
